                    <h3>Opening Scene</h3>
                    <p>The café buzzed with the familiar sounds of Santiago—the clink of spoons against ceramic cups, the soft murmur of Spanish conversations, and the distant hum of traffic on Avenida Providencia. Henri sat at his usual table by the window, laptop open but forgotten, watching the world outside with the kind of attention that comes from being somewhere new and beautiful.</p>
                    <blockquote>'Sometimes the most profound connections happen in the most ordinary moments.'</blockquote>
                    <p>That's when Ruben walked in, carrying the weight of his family's expectations and the quiet determination of someone who knows exactly who they are. Their eyes met across the crowded room, and in that instant, Henri understood that his carefully planned research trip was about to become something entirely different.</p>

                    <h3>Central Themes</h3>
                    <p>Henri & Ruben explores the universal human experience through the lens of cultural exchange and personal transformation:</p>
                    <h4>Cultural Identity & Belonging</h4>
                    <p>Both characters grapple with questions of identity and belonging. Henri, as an American in Chile, experiences the vulnerability of being an outsider while discovering new aspects of himself. Ruben, though in his home country, faces the challenge of balancing family expectations with his own desires and dreams.</p>
                    <h4>The Universal Language of Love</h4>
                    <p>Despite their cultural differences, Henri and Ruben discover that love transcends language, nationality, and tradition. Their relationship becomes a testament to the idea that human connection is more fundamental than any cultural barrier.</p>
