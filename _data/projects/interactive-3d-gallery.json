    "pitch":  "A cutting-edge 3D interactive gallery where users can explore a physics-driven sphere, position images with precision, and seamlessly transition between immersive 3D exploration and detailed 2D viewing.",
    "challenge":  "The core challenge was solving the inherent conflict between a physics engine (Cannon.js) wanting to control an object\u0027s state, and a declarative animation library (Tween.js/react-spring) also wanting to control it, which led to unpredictable visual bugs like an image expanding and then immediately snapping back.",
    "development":  "The project was built on React Three Fiber for its declarative 3D capabilities. The breakthrough was a shift to a hybrid 2D/3D model, where a \u0027click-to-transfer\u0027 paradigm was developed, which hands off a selected image from the 3D physics sphere to a dedicated 2D viewport, intelligently pausing physics to ensure smooth, predictable animations.",
    "outcome":  "The result is a highly performant and extensible platform for digital galleries. It successfully implements a novel Z-axis prioritization method and offers a uniquely engaging \u0027Browse\u0027 mode, proving the value of hybrid design for practical, complex web applications.",
