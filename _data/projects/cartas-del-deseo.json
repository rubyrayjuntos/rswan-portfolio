Users receive real-time readings from <strong>Papi Chispa</strong>—a velvet-voiced, Spanglish oracle rendered in dramatic Cartas del Deseo visuals.",

  "challenge": "Orchestrating dynamic <strong>AI storytelling</strong> and reusable front-end components within a flexible, JSON-driven structure—without sacrificing poetry or performance.",
  "development": "The system was designed using a <em>content-first</em> approach. A decoupled architecture allowed tarot content and persona voice to live in JSON, while the <strong>Lazy Léon UI system</strong> handled theming, animation, and interactive flow. Integration with <code>GPT-4</code> brought emotional narrative and voice consistency to the experience.",
  "outcome": "The final build is a fully responsive, interactive tarot experience that feels like <em>you’re being seduced by code</em>. Every spread is a scene. Every reading, a confession. <strong>Papi</strong> guides users through ritualized UX, offering spreads like <code>The Pact</code> and <code>Forbidden Flame</code>—each accompanied by dramatic visuals and voice-rich narration.",
