  "challenge": "Developing a systematic approach to character design that ensures depth and complexity while maintaining visual appeal and clear communication of character traits.",
  "development": "Created a structured methodology for character development, including personality mapping, visual design principles, and iterative refinement processes.",
  "outcome": "A comprehensive character design system that produces compelling, multi-dimensional characters suitable for various media and storytelling contexts.",
  "process": "The character design process begins with deep personality mapping, translating character traits into visual elements. This is followed by iterative sketching, refinement, and testing across different contexts to ensure the character works in various situations.",
  "inspiration": "Inspired by the need for more systematic approaches to character development in creative industries. The methodology draws from psychology, visual design principles, and storytelling techniques to create characters with genuine depth and appeal.",
