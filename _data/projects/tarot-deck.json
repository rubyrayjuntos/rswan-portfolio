  "pitch": "What if each tarot card was not a character—but an actor caught mid-performance? The Pageant Tarot invites you to witness the archetypes, not as frozen icons, but as living, breathing roles on the grand stage of the soul.",
  "challenge": "Capturing both the symbolic gravity and performative tension of the archetypes in a single still frame—where story, intention, and myth must all co-exist.",
  "development": "Each image began with study—of traditional tarot meaning, of gesture and theatricality, of costume and silhouette. From there, I sculpted tableaux that vibrate with story, letting each archetype act through light, gaze, and posture.",
  "outcome": "The Pageant Tarot becomes both a deck and a gallery—a performance in 78 acts, inviting viewers to interpret not just meaning, but motion, tension, and character. A tarot for the visual poet, the reader, and the audience within.",
