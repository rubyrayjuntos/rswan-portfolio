  "pitch": "Environmental storytelling through set design, where every location tells a story and shapes the characters who inhabit it.",
  "challenge": "Creating environments that not only look compelling but also serve the narrative, revealing character traits and advancing the story through visual design.",
  "development": "Developed a systematic approach to environmental storytelling, where each set element contributes to character development and narrative progression.",
  "outcome": "A comprehensive set design methodology that enhances storytelling through environmental design and atmospheric detail.",
  "process": "<h3>A Tale of Two Worlds</h3><p>The creative process was a journey in itself, balancing two key elements: the intimate, character-driven spaces and the grand, narrative-defining environments.</p><h4>1. Character-Centric Design</h4><p>We started by asking, 'What does this character's home say about them?' This led to detailed studies of personal props, color palettes, and architectural styles that reflected their inner world.</p><h4>2. Narrative-Driven Environments</h4><p>Next, we designed key locations that would advance the plot. A seemingly innocent market stall, for example, was designed with hidden compartments and sightlines that would be crucial for a later scene.</p>",
  "inspiration": "<h3>The Soul of a Place</h3><p>Inspiration for this project came from the idea that environments are characters in their own right. We drew from the moody, atmospheric cinematography of film noir, the intricate world-building of epic fantasy novels, and the subtle environmental storytelling in games like 'What Remains of Edith Finch'.</p><p>The goal was to create spaces that felt lived-in and layered with history, where every object and architectural choice tells a story about the people who inhabit them.</p>",
