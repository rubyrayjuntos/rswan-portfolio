## **1. Core Information**

- **Title:** Interactive 3D Gallery Sphere
- **Pitch:** A cutting-edge 3D interactive gallery where users can explore a physics-driven sphere, position images with precision, and seamlessly transition between immersive 3D exploration and detailed 2D viewing.
- **Description:** Experience images in a revolutionary hybrid 2D/3D environment. This project uses React Three Fiber and a Cannon.js physics engine to create an intuitive and engaging alternative to traditional 2D galleries, allowing for unique interactions like Z-axis prioritization and physics-driven exploration.
- **Challenge:** The core challenge was solving the inherent conflict between a physics engine (Cannon.js) wanting to control an object's state, and a declarative animation library (Tween.js/react-spring) also wanting to control it, which led to unpredictable visual bugs like an image expanding and then immediately snapping back.
- **Development:** The project was built on React Three Fiber for its declarative 3D capabilities. The breakthrough was a shift from a pure 3D interaction model to a hybrid 2D/3D approach. A 'click-to-transfer' paradigm was developed, which hands off a selected image from the 3D physics sphere to a dedicated 2D viewport, intelligently pausing physics to ensure smooth, predictable animations.
- **Outcome:** The result is a highly performant and extensible platform for digital galleries. It successfully implements a novel Z-axis prioritization method and offers a uniquely engaging 'Browse' mode, proving the value of hybrid design for practical, complex web applications.

## **4. Architectural Pillars (Specs)**

- **Spec 1 Title:** Hybrid 2D/3D Viewport
  - **Spec 1 Description:** Seamlessly transitions from an immersive 3D sphere to a detailed 2D view, solving common 3D UI problems like occlusion and providing the best of both worlds.
- **Spec 2 Title:** Physics-Driven Interaction
  - **Spec 2 Description:** Uses the Cannon.js physics engine for realistic sphere rotation, while intelligently overriding physics with animations for precise user control.
- **Spec 3 Title:** Innovative Z-Axis Prioritization
  - **Spec 3 Description:** A novel UX pattern allowing users to use depth (Z-axis) to organize and prioritize images in 3D space, controlled intuitively with keyboard and mouse combinations.
- **Spec 4 Title:** Performant Instanced Rendering
  - **Spec 4 Description:** Utilizes THREE.InstancedMesh and texture atlases to efficiently render a large number of images on the sphere, ensuring a smooth experience.
- **Spec 5 Title:** Robust State Management
  - **Spec 5 Description:** Employs a sophisticated event system and React Context to manage complex state, including focus tracking, physics pausing, and dynamic instance hiding.
- **Spec 6 Title:** Declarative 3D with R3F
