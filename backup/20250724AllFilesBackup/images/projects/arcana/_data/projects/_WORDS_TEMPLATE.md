# ✍️ Project Template: Words (Writing)

Use this template to structure the content for a new **writing** project. This "content-first" approach allows you to focus on the narrative and creative vision. I will then translate this into a fully functional, immersive user journey on the website.

---

## **1. Core Information**

Provide the essential details for the project.

- **Title:** The official title of the novel, story, or collection.
- **Pitch:** A one-sentence hook. What is the central question or idea? (e.g., "A brilliant but disgraced historian must team up with a roguish star-pilot to uncover a cosmic conspiracy that threatens to unravel the fabric of the galaxy.")
- **Description:** A slightly longer, one-paragraph description for the main portfolio grid.
- **Challenge:** What was the primary creative or technical challenge you faced while writing?
- **Development:** How did you approach the project? What was your outlining, drafting, or editing process?
- **Outcome:** What was the final result? What did the story become?

## **2. Thematic Deep Dive**

This is the heart of the writing journey, where you share the substance of your work. Use HTML to format the content for the best reading experience.

### **Excerpts**
*(This will populate the "Excerpts" section. Provide compelling passages, character introductions, or pivotal scenes. Use `<h3>` for scene titles and `<blockquote>` for impactful quotes.)*
> Example: `<h3>Opening Scene</h3><p>The café buzzed with the familiar sounds of Santiago—the clink of spoons against ceramic cups, the soft murmur of Spanish conversations...</p><blockquote>'Sometimes the most profound connections happen in the most ordinary moments.'</blockquote>`

### **Themes & Analysis**
*(This will populate the "Themes & Analysis" section. Discuss the core philosophical and narrative themes. Use `<h3>` and `<h4>` to structure your analysis.)*
> Example: `<h3>Central Themes</h3><p>Henri & Ruben explores the universal human experience through the lens of cultural exchange...</p><h4>Cultural Identity & Belonging</h4><p>Both characters grapple with questions of identity and belonging...</p>`

## **3. The Author's Journey**

This corresponds to the "Journey" and "Specs" sections on the project page.

### **Storyboard Flow (The Journey)**
Describe the narrative of your writing process. Each item will become a step in the scrolling "Journey" timeline.

| Scene Order | `title` (Thematic Title) | `description` (Process Note) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | The Initial Spark | A chance encounter in a dusty archive sparked the central question... |
| 2 | Mapping the Constellations | Outlining the plot with a complex web of character arcs and plot points. |
| 3 | The First Draft Sprint | Writing the chaotic, energetic first draft in three months. |
| 4 | The Sculptor's Pass | Editing and reshaping the narrative, cutting away what wasn't essential. |

### **Unique Elements (The Specs)**
What are the key literary or structural strengths of this project? Each item here will become a "Unique Value Proposition" (a Spec card).

- **Spec 1 Title:** Dual POV Narrative
  - **Spec 1 Description:** The story is told through two competing first-person perspectives, forcing the reader to question the nature of truth.
- **Spec 2 Title:** Non-linear Timeline
  - **Spec 2 Description:** The plot unfolds across three different time periods, slowly revealing how the past created the present.

## **4. Visual World (Gallery)**

Even writing projects have a visual element. Include concept art, character sketches, cover art, or inspirational photos.

**Image 1:**
- **`url`:** `images/projects/your-project/cover-art.jpg`
- **`title`:** Official Cover Art
- **`description`:** The final cover design, capturing the central conflict of the story.

**Image 2:**
- **`url`:** `images/projects/your-project/character-sketch.jpg`
- **`title`:** Early Character Sketch
- **`description`:** An early concept sketch of the protagonist, showing the initial visual ideas.
