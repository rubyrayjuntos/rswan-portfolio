# üíª Project Template: Systems (Code)

Use this template to structure the content for a new **code** project. This "content-first" approach allows you to focus on the technical narrative and architectural vision. I will then translate this into a fully functional, informative user journey on the website.

---

## **1. Core Information**

Provide the essential details for the project.

- **Title:** The official name of the application, system, or tool.
- **Pitch:** A one-sentence hook. What is the core problem this project solves? (e.g., "A sophisticated, data-driven interactive web portfolio that transcends traditional showcases by creating immersive, narrative-led user journeys.")
- **Description:** A slightly longer, one-paragraph description for the main portfolio grid.
- **Challenge:** What was the primary architectural or technical challenge you faced?
- **Development:** How did you approach building the system? What was your methodology (e.g., agile, iterative)? What was the architecture?
- **Outcome:** What was the final result? What did you build, and what were the key accomplishments?

## **2. Technical Deep Dive**

This section is where you can showcase the technical and architectural substance of your work.

### **Project Artifacts**
*(This will populate the "Project Artifacts" section. This is the most important part of the code journey. Link to key documents, diagrams, and repositories. You can link to markdown files within the project, which will be rendered in a modal.)*

- **Artifact 1:**
  - `name`: System Architecture
  - `description`: A detailed breakdown of the front-end and back-end architecture.
  - `url`: `_data/projects/your-project/docs/architecture.md`
  - `icon`: `üèõÔ∏è`
- **Artifact 2:**
  - `name`: API Documentation
  - `description`: Swagger or Postman documentation for the project's API.
  - `url`: `#` (Link to external documentation)
  - `icon`: `üîå`
- **Artifact 3:**
  - `name`: GitHub Repository
  - `description`: The primary source code repository for the project.
  - `url`: `#` (Link to GitHub)
  - `icon`: `‚≠ê`

## **3. The Developer's Journey**

This corresponds to the "Journey" and "Specs" sections on the project page.

### **Storyboard Flow (The Journey)**
Describe the narrative of your development process. Each item will become a step in the scrolling "Journey" timeline.

| Scene Order | `title` (Thematic Title) | `description` (Process Note) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Phase 1: The Monolith | Began with a single-page application to quickly validate the core concept. |
| 2 | Phase 2: The Great Decoupling | Separated the front-end from the data layer, creating a flexible JSON-driven system. |
| 3 | Phase 3: The Parallax Engine | Built the dynamic parallax and theme engine for immersive storytelling. |
| 4 | Phase 4: The Content-First Workflow | Refined the system to be driven by external markdown files, perfecting the creative process. |

### **Architectural Pillars (The Specs)**
What are the key technical or architectural strengths of this project? Each item here will become a "Unique Value Proposition" (a Spec card).

- **Spec 1 Title:** Data-Driven Architecture
  - **Spec 1 Description:** The entire front-end is dynamically rendered based on a collection of JSON files, allowing for rapid content updates without touching the code.
- **Spec 2 Title:** Modular & Reusable Components
  - **Spec 2 Description:** Built with a component-based philosophy, ensuring that UI elements are consistent, reusable, and easy to maintain.

## **4. Visual Showcase (Gallery)**

Even technical projects have a visual side. Include screenshots, architecture diagrams, or UI mockups.

**Image 1:**
- **`url`:** `images/projects/your-project/screenshot-dashboard.jpg`
- **`title`:** Admin Dashboard
- **`description`:** A screenshot of the administrative dashboard, showcasing the project management interface.

**Image 2:**
- **`url`:** `images/projects/your-project/architecture-diagram.jpg`
- **`title`:** System Architecture
- **`description`:** A high-level diagram illustrating the flow of data from the back-end to the front-end components.
