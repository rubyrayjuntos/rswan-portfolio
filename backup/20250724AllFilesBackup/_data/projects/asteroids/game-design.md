## Code Examples

### Basic Game Loop
```javascript
class GameLoop {
    constructor() {
        this.lastTime = 0;
        this.entities = [];
    }
    
    update(deltaTime) {
        this.entities.forEach(entity => {
            entity.update(deltaTime);
        });
    }
    
    render() {
        this.entities.forEach(entity => {
            entity.render();
        });
    }
}
```

### Touch Control Handler
```javascript
class TouchController {
    constructor() {
        this.touchStartX = 0;
        this.touchStartY = 0;
        this.isTouching = false;
    }
    
    handleTouchStart(event) {
        this.touchStartX = event.touches[0].clientX;
        this.touchStartY = event.touches[0].clientY;
        this.isTouching = true;
    }
    
    handleTouchMove(event) {
        if (!this.isTouching) return;
        
        const deltaX = event.touches[0].clientX - this.touchStartX;
        const deltaY = event.touches[0].clientY - this.touchStartY;
        
        this.updatePlayerMovement(deltaX, deltaY);
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

This modernized Asteroids implementation successfully bridges the gap between classic arcade gameplay and contemporary mobile gaming expectations. By carefully preserving the core mechanics while adapting to touch interfaces, we've created an experience that honors the original while embracing modern technology.

The project demonstrates the importance of thoughtful adaptation when bringing classic games to new platforms, ensuring that the essence of the original experience remains intact while leveraging the capabilities of modern devices.
