  "about": "I began my career building educational software — crafting tools that made learning more accessible and engaging. But what started as utility evolved into passion: the realization that *technology itself could be a creative medium*. Over time, I embraced my role as a synthesist: weaving together the logic of development, the emotion of visual art, and the resonance of story into unified experiences.\n\nThis portfolio reflects that journey — a collection of work that bridges disciplines and challenges boundaries. Whether designing immersive web applications, writing speculative fiction, or experimenting with visual design systems, my focus remains the same: exploring the ways digital and human expression can meet, and creating work that feels alive.",
