    "process":  "<h3>The Character Design Journey</h3><p>The character design process begins with deep personality mapping, translating character traits into visual elements. This is followed by iterative sketching, refinement, and testing across different contexts to ensure the character works in various situations.</p><h4>1. Personality Mapping</h4><p>We start by creating detailed personality profiles, identifying core traits, motivations, and backstory elements that will inform every visual decision.</p><h4>2. Visual Translation</h4><p>These personality elements are then translated into visual language—color palettes, shapes, textures, and proportions that reflect the character's inner world.</p><h4>3. Iterative Refinement</h4><p>Multiple iterations allow us to test the character across different contexts and refine the design until it perfectly captures the intended personality and appeal.</p>",
    "inspiration":  "<h3>Systematic Creativity</h3><p>Inspired by the need for more systematic approaches to character development in creative industries. The methodology draws from psychology, visual design principles, and storytelling techniques to create characters with genuine depth and appeal.</p><p>We looked to the structured approaches used in animation studios, the psychological depth of literary character development, and the visual storytelling techniques of concept artists to create a comprehensive system that ensures every character has both visual appeal and emotional resonance.</p>",
