It bridges old-world symbolism and cutting-edge technology to create a truly personal, immersive experience.",
  "challenge": "- Designing prompts and system messages to encourage creative, human-like interpretations of cards while staying contextually accurate.\n- Ensuring users feel each reading is specific to them — not a prewritten blurb.\n- Creating an interface that complements the spiritual tone while remaining accessible and responsive across devices.\n- Balancing simplicity in UX with the rich symbolism of tarot.",
  "development": "- Crafted a fine-tuned prompt and memory architecture for the Gemini API that understands the interplay between tarot cards.\n- Developed a minimalist front-end with vanilla JS, HTML5, and CSS Grid to keep the app light yet responsive.\n- Designed a meditative UI theme, employing calming colors and accessible contrast while embracing mystical motifs.\n- Optimized UX for mobile and desktop alike, including ARIA support for screen readers and WCAG compliance.\n- User tested with both tarot enthusiasts and first-time users to refine tone and flow.",
  "outcome": "- Avg. session time: 5+ minutes — a clear sign of user engagement.\n- Users praised the depth and authenticity of AI-generated readings.\n- Positive feedback highlighted the intuitive, calming UI and its harmony with the spiritual theme.\n- Sparked conversations about integrating AI into other spiritual and creative tools.",
