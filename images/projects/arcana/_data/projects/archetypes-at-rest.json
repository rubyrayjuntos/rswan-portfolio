    "pitch":  "What happens when archetypes are stripped of their mystical costumes and shown as just humans at the bus stop, in a diner, or doing laundry? Are they still divine? Are we?",
    "challenge":  "The core challenge was to transpose these sacred, powerful archetypes into mundane settings without losing their mythic resonance, creating a delicate balance between the divine and the everyday.",
    "development":  "Each piece began with extensive research into the chosen archetypes, followed by location scouting in everyday places. The goal was to find the perfect visual tension—the laundromat for Temperance, the diner for the Hierophant—that would spark a new conversation about these ancient symbols.",
    "outcome":  "The result is a collection of images that invite viewers to find the tarot’s wisdom in themselves, not as distant ideals but as everyday truths. Each piece asks: Which card are you playing today?",
    "process":  "\u003ch3\u003eThe Sacred in the Banal\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe creative process for \u003cem\u003eArchetypes at Rest\u003c/em\u003e was one of translation. It involved taking the grand, symbolic language of the tarot and finding its quiet echo in the modern world. Each composition is intentionally framed like a classical painting to elevate the scene, while the warm, glowing light suggests a universal divinity that persists even in the most ordinary moments.\u003c/p\u003e",
    "inspiration":  "\u003ch3\u003eFinding the Mythic in the Mundane\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis series was inspired by the idea that our lives are already full of myth and meaning—if only we stop to see them. It explores the tension and irony of placing timeless figures in contemporary contexts: the Hierophant\u0027s authority in a fast-food booth, the Lovers\u0027 sacred choice at a noisy bar. The goal is to make these archetypes more accessible, more human, and to encourage viewers to recognize these powerful forces within their own lives.\u003c/p\u003e",
